      You can visit all public areas of our site without providing any personal
      information. Our site collects only non-personal information based on a
      visitor’s Internet Protocol (IP) address (this is not personally
      identifiable). Information collected includes the date and time of visit,
      the type of Internet browser used to access the site, the referring
      address (the link a visitor uses to access the site). This data is used to
      create statistics on site usage and improve online services.

      Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which
      pages you visited throughout our site.
    </p>

    <h2 class="terms__blue">Do we use cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes (Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers
      to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that
      enables the sites or service providers systems to recognise your browser

      Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a
      string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web
      browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to
      the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies
      may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent
      cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set
      expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session
      cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session,
      when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any
      information that personally identifies a user, but personal information
      that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and
      obtained from cookies. We use only session cookies / on our website.}

      </li>
      <li>
        To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website

      of production, and to exclude viruses from this website. It is always wise
      for you to run an up to date anti-virus program on all the material
